1.Introduce your comparison of two places or two time periods. Why do you want to make this comparison? Make sure this narrative will be stored in a ‘readme.md’.

I have decided to pick the two time periods based on the same location that is provided. I chose a minute and two minutes for the time periods since I assume that in a short amount of time, there would be bigger information that might exceed twice or thrice the previous data. The reason I preferred to choose the two-time period is because rather than comparing locations, I would like to analyze information that is retrieved in one specific location over time.

In this case, the topic is coronavirus. So, my observation would be based on tweets that are filtered with this trend. This comparison would inform me the first place that the information was being input and where was the source. On top of that, by having another time of period, I could easily see how the information is spread. For my map, these points are plotted by blue dots for the first time and red dots for the second time. These dots would depict the latest area that was ‘tweeting’ and beyond that there would be either new dots (which are red) appearing near to the previous one or overlapped on top of each other. Next, I would like to make this comparison because I am curious regarding the east and west coast. How’s the information is shared between the coasts? And which coast dominate the use of twitter? 

Overall, I would like to see the number of tweets that are tweeted out between a minute and two minutes. Also, how these tweets pop out in new areas? Whether they are far away or closed to each other.

2.Export the two maps to the repository and then insert them to the readme.md. Please compare them and briefly discuss why they represent different geospatial patterns on the map

As you can see below, these maps are representing geospatial patterns that are caused by the difference of time. First map with red dots was produced after a minute, while the second map with blue dots was produced after two minutes. 
	
  Based on these two maps, I would argue that the tweets which have the content or theme about coronavirus seems to be increased after a minute. In addition, from my perspective, I assume that these new tweets (which are colored in blue dots) are appearing closed to their previous one. I think that it is indicating that the users might have shared the same information, but this time the area coverage is greater than before. Nevertheless, there is not much different in Midwest. I am predicting that they are less users in this area or another reason for this could be that in this area may not have been affected much than those who are living in the east and west coast. Not only that, but another possibility could also be that the information that is shared publicly have not spread out to this area yet. 
	
  The reason they represent different geospatial patterns on the map is because over a specific time, there are different number of tweets that are tweeted out and it seems that the numbers are unpredictable. Based on my quick observation, I was predicting that the numbers would be doubled since it is only between one and two minutes, but my prediction was inaccurate. Judging by the second map, I could analyze that these blue dots are appearing more than the red dots. So, my conclusion is that every minute, there would be new information which they are uncountable due to the number of users and trend.

3. Export the two-word clouds to the repository and then insert them to the readme.md. Please compare them and briefly discuss why they represent different context.

For the two-word clouds, I would like to have a fix shape so it would be easier for me to compare and in this case, I have used the heart shapes. Where the heart shape colored in red is based on the first minute tweets, while the other is representing the tweets that are collected in two minutes. 

If we compare these two images, we could see that there is a different ‘trend’ that the twitter users have used. For example, the word ‘Good’ and ‘CO’ which are the most appealing word in each word clouds. I assume that over a minute, the trend is associated with the word ‘Good’, but on the other hand, after a minute has passed, the word ‘Co’ is more standing out. Based on my knowledge about twitter, this app has the trending feature which covers what are the current ‘hot’ topics that people talk about? Due to this, I assume that these words ‘Good’ and ‘Co’ are being repeated frequently.

On the other perspective, there are similarities between these two-word clouds, like ‘Job’, ‘Need’, and ‘Love’. This suggest that the existed tweets are still covering these themes, even though some of them are less readable, like the word ‘Love’. Thus, the word ‘Job’ seems to have the same size, and this leads me to the idea that maybe during this pandemic, coronavirus has made jobs availability to be less than previous years. The other potential reason could be that people may have lost jobs. 

Overall, the reason why the two-word clouds are representing different context is because every minute, there could be a new event that the United States may experience. Due to this event, the context has been shifted to the most ‘trending’ one. That is why these two images do not share the same content.
